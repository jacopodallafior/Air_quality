# AIR QUALITY PREDICTOR üåçüí®  

**Air Quality Predictor** is an advanced machine learning system designed to forecast air quality levels at *Serso via dei Caduti*, leveraging a feature store for integrated batch and real-time data pipelines. Inspired by O'Reilly's *Building Machine Learning Systems with a Feature Store: Batch, Real-Time, and LLMs*, this project demonstrates the power of scalable and interactive ML systems.

---

## üìå Pipeline Overview  

The system is structured following the pipeline shown below.  
It integrates data collection, processing, management via a feature store, and prediction based on ML models.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### 1. View Predictions  

#### With Rolling Window Features  
Access predictions that utilize rolling window features on the [Interactive Dashboard](https://jacopodallafior.github.io/Air_Quality_Rolling_Window/air-quality/).  

#### Without Rolling Window Features  
Explore predictions without rolling window features on this [Interactive Dashboard](https://jacopodallafior.github.io/Air_quality/air-quality/).  

### 2. Request a Prediction

## Rolling Window Prediction Details  

This version implements air quality prediction using rolling window features to enhance the model's accuracy and prediction capabilities.  

### Rolling Window Feature Update  

1. **Rolling Window Calculation**  
   The dataset includes a new feature: a 3-day rolling mean of the PM2.5 values, calculated as follows:  
   ```python
   df_roll['pm25_3day_roll_mean'] = df_roll['pm25'].rolling(window=3).mean()
   ```

2. **Daily Feature Updates**  
   A notebook (**2_air_quality_feature_pipeline.ipynb**) recalculates the rolling window mean daily using real-time PM2.5 data.  

3. **Enhanced Predictions**  
   The rolling window feature, combined with weather data, provides accurate predictions for future PM2.5 levels.
